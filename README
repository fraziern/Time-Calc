This is a billable hour calculator I wrote as 1) a useful tool for 
myself, and 2) as a working project for learning and playing with Java, 
TDD, github, javadoc, and other programming-related tools and processes.

The calculator has its foundations in the TenthTime class, which models
a time entry and implementations of  various basic operations on those 
time entries.
