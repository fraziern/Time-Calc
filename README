This is a billable hour calculator I wrote as 1) a useful tool for 
myself, and 2) as a working project for learning and playing with Java, 
TDD, github, javadoc, and other programming-related tools and processes.

The calculator has its foundations in the TenthTime class, which models
a time entry and implementations of  various basic operations on those 
time entries.

It also implements a simple "spellcheck" algorithm that uses a Bayesian
statistical model to try and guess what the bad speller meant. I put
together the model with Gaussian curves at 9:00 and 5:00, assuming that
those are the most popular working hours. That's right--rudimentary AI. 
Do I need to even say that this was my favorite part of the project so far?
